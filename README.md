## Overview

This challenge was a great introduction to CSS Grid. I learned the basics of Grid and how it works. I kept it simple for now, but I realised that it is very powerfull and it can do things that flexbox can't.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I Started by styling the elements before I put them in the design's layout. This is different from how I normally do things but it's because I was learning something new and wanted to start off with basic styling so I could focus more on Grid.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Utility Classes
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned the basics of CSS Grid, how it works and how to position elements using it. As I've said, I kept it very simple for now since Grid is still very new to me. I also learned how to set up utility classes to avoid repeating myself. I'll definitely use them alot more together with custom properties not only to avoid repetition, but also to make it easier to maintain. 


### Continued development

I'll come back and refactor the CSS code once I've had some experience setting up custom properties.
